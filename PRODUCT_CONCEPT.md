# Product Concept Document: Riyaaz Pad

**Product Name:** Riyaaz Pad  
**Tagline:** *The Feel of the Drum. The Gift of Silence.*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Riyaaz Pad is a specialized percussion practice tool designed to mimic the tactile response and ergonomic layout of the Tabla (Dayan and Bayan). Unlike standard drum pads, it features multi-zone surfaces to simulate the Chanti, Maidan, and Syahi, allowing students to practice complex finger patterns (Bols) silently and portably.

## 2. Phase 1: Project Brief for Prototype Development

**Objective:** Create a "Works-Like" bench model to prove the ergonomics and tactile zones.

### Technical Requirements

- **Tactile Zones:**
  - **High-Rebound Rim (Chanti):** Harder durometer for sharp strikes.
  - **Weighted Center (Syahi):** Damped, high-density material to mimic the black spot.
  - **Compression Base (Bayan):** Softer surface to allow for "pitch-bending" pressure simulation.

- **Chassis:** A non-slip, weighted base (3–5 lbs) angled to mimic traditional seating.

- **Materials:** High-density silicone/rubber, 3D-printed or CNC-machined housing.

### Deliverables

- **CAD Files:** STEP/STL and native design files.
- **Bill of Materials (BOM):** Sourcing list for all rubbers, weights, and plastics.
- **Physical Prototype:** One playable unit for user testing.

## 3. Demand Evaluation & Market Strategy

### Market Size (U.S. Focus)

- **Estimated Annual New Students:** 5,000–8,000
- **Primary Audience:** Indian diaspora students, university ethnomusicology programs, and professional musicians needing a travel/apartment-friendly tool.

### Validation Strategy

- **The "Expert" Survey:** Send a 5-question survey to major institutions (e.g., Ali Akbar College of Music) to gauge instructor buy-in.
- **Pre-Sale Landing Page:** Launch a "coming soon" page to collect email leads; 500+ sign-ups indicate a viable production run.
- **Keyword Analysis:** Monitor search volume for "Silent Tabla," "Travel Tabla," and "Tabla Practice."

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Finalize the Project Brief:** Use the draft provided above to post on hiring platforms.
2. **Interview Engineers:** Look for portfolios featuring consumer electronics or tactile products (e.g., computer mice, sporting goods).
3. **Secure Intellectual Property:** Consider a provisional patent if the "pressure-sensitive" Bayan mechanism is unique.
